  <p>I am a PhD student of <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/dominic-verity">Dominic Verity</a> and <a href="http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~street/">Ross Street</a> at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. </p>

  <p>My thesis (titled: The Gray tensor product for 2-quasi-categories) is currently under examination.
  It has been divided into two papers which you can find on arXiv (links at items [1,2] below).</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.msri.org/seminars/24902">Here</a> (no. 8) is my 5 minute self-introduction from the <a href="https://www.msri.org/programs/323">Higher Categories and Categorificaction</a> program at the MSRI in spring 2020.</p>

  <p>I am interested in category theory in general, and so far my research has focused on (∞,n)-categories.
  </p>

  <h2>Publications and preprints</h2>

  <h3>(∞,n)-categories</h3>
  <details><summary>About the papers</summary>
    <p>[1,2] below are essentially the two halves of my PhD thesis.
    I show in [1] that Ara's model structure for 2-quasi-categories can be characterised using Oury's inner horns, and then use them in [2] to prove that the 2-quasi-categorical Gray tensor product (defined in the paper) forms part of a "homotopical" biclosed monoidal structure.<br>
    In [3], we propose a model for weak ω-categories (aka (∞,∞)-categories) using marked cubical sets, analogous to Verity's complicial model.</p></details>

  <h3>Mahavier limits/generalised inverse limits</h3>
  <details><summary>What are these limits?</summary>
    <p>
    This is a generalisation of the notion of inverse limit (of topological spaces) where one allows the diagram to involve continuous-ish multi-valued maps.
    Continuum theorists were particularly interested in complicated spaces that can be built as inverse limits of very simple spaces such as the unit interval, and introduced this generalisation as a tool for constructing/analysing even more complicated spaces.<br>
    For my honours project (supervised by <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/people/sgre015">Sina Greenwood</a>, Auckland University), I characterised these "limits" by a certain universal property.</p>

  <h3>First-order characterisations of groups</h3>
  <details><summary>About the project</summary>
  <p>This is a summer project I did between the second and third years of my undergraduate (supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~nies/">Andr&eacute; Nies</a>, Auckland University).<br>
  The last section ("Polylogarithmic compressibility") of my report below is original, and some of the material there appeared in Section 2 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8390">this paper</a> of Nies and Tent.</p>
