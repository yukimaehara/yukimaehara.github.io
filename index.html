  <p>I am a PhD student of Dominic Verity at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. <br>
  My thesis (titled: The Gray tensor product for 2-quasi-categories) is currently under examination.
  It has been divided into two papers which you can find on arXiv (links below).<br>
  <a href="https://www.msri.org/seminars/24902">Here</a> (no. 8) is my 5 minute self-introduction from the Higher Categories and Categorificaction program at the MSRI in spring 2020.</p>

  <h2>Publications</h2>

  <h3>2-quasi-categories</h3>
  <p>My main research interest is (∞,2)-category theory.
  The two papers below are essentially two halves of my PhD thesis, which constructs an (∞,2)-version of the (lax) Gray tensor product.</p>
  <ol reversed>
   <li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11757" class="paper">The Gray tensor product for 2-quasi-categories</a>, preprint.</li>
   <li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08720" class="paper">Inner horns for 2-quasi-categories</a>, Advances in Mathematics, 363:107003, 2020.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Mahavier limits/generalised inverse limits</h3>
  <p>For my honours project (supervised by Sina Greenwood, Auckland University), I characterised these "limits" by a certain universal property.</p>

  	<li>(with Ittay Weiss) <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299564580_Mahavier_completeness_and_classifying_diagrams" class="paper">Mahavier completeness and classifying diagrams</a>, Topology and its applications, vol.229, 55-69, 2017.</li>
  	<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.topol.2016.02.007" class="paper">Categories of inverse systems of compacta with upper semi-continuous bonding functions</a>, Topology and its Applications, vol.204, 23-40, 2016.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>First-order characterisations of groups</h3>
  <p>This is a summer project I did between the second and third years of my undergraduate (supervised by Andr&eacute; Nies, Auckland University).<br>
  The last section ("Polylogarithmic compressibility") of my report below is original, and some of the material there appeared in Section 2 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8390">this paper</a> of Nies and Tent.</p>
